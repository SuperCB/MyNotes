>  An  odd-eyed cat  is a cat with one blue eye and one eye either green, yellow,
 or brown. This is a  feline  form of  complete heterochromia , a condition 
 that occurs in some other animals, including humans. There is also partial heterochromia, where there can be one blue eye and one eye that is partially blue and partially another color. The condition most commonly affects white cats, but may be found in a cat of any color, provided that it possesses the  white-spotting gene . This white domestic cat has complete heterochromia, with a blue left eye and a yellow right eye.
