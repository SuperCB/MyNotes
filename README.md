>  Bolungarvík  is a small town and the only built-up area in the municipality of Bolungarvíkurkaupstaður in the northwest of Iceland, located on the peninsula of the  Westfjords , approximately 14 kilometres (8.7 miles) from the town of  Ísafjörður  and 473 kilometres (294 miles) from the capital city  Reykjavík . The town is near abundant fishing grounds and has been used as an outpost for fishing since the 17th century, making it one of the earliest in Iceland. Bolungarvík was not accessible by road until 1950, and in 2010  a tunnel  was opened under the mountain to bypass the old road, which was frequently subject to avalanches and rock falls. This panoramic photograph of Bolungarvík was taken in early July 2018 from the  avalanche dam  that overlooks the town.  Lupin , which covers much of this area of Iceland in summer, is visible at the extreme bottom left of the image.
