>  Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington  (1769–1852) was an  Anglo-Irish  soldier and  Tory  statesman who was one of the leading military and political figures of  19th-century Britain , serving twice as  prime minister . He is one of the commanders who won and ended the  Napoleonic Wars  when  a coalition of European powers  defeated  Napoleon  at the  Battle of Waterloo  on 18 June 1815. This oil-on-canvas portrait, painted by  Sir Thomas Lawrence  shortly after the Battle of Waterloo, depicts Wellington wearing the uniform of a  field marshal  with the insignia of the  Order of the Garter  and the  Order of the Golden Fleece . The painting is part of the collection of  Apsley House , the London townhouse of the  Dukes of Wellington .
