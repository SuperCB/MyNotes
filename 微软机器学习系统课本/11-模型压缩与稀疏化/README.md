> The  diamond firetail  ( Stagonopleura guttata ) is a species of  estrildid finch  that is endemic to Australia. To safeguard their eggs and nestlings, they are often recorded building their nests into the base of the large stick-nest of a bird of prey, such as a  whistling kite ,  white-bellied sea eagle ,  wedge-tailed eagle ,  brown falcon ,  nankeen kestrel , or  square-tailed kite ; one recorded nest of a whistling kite contained nine diamond firetail nests within. This diamond firetail was photographed in  Glen Alice, New South Wales .
