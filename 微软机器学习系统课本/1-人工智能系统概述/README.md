> ***[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anatomy_Lesson_of_Dr._Nicolaes_Tulp)*** is a 1632 oil-on-canvas painting by [Rembrandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt) housed in the [Mauritshuis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritshuis) museum in [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague), Netherlands. The painting is regarded as one of Rembrandt's early masterpieces. In the work, [Nicolaes Tulp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaes_Tulp) is pictured explaining the [musculature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) of the arm to a group of doctors. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner *Rembrandt. f[ecit] 1632*. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogram *RHL* ("Rembrandt Harmenszoon of [Leiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden)"), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.
